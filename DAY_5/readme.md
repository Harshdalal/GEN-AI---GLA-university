# Capstone Project

# ðŸ“˜ Capstone Project Guidelines

# ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To apply the concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) learned in class to solve a real-world problem by building, training, optimizing, and deploying a model in a team-based project.

# ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Team Formation & Planning 

```
Form teams of 3â€“5 members.

Assign roles:

Project Manager â€“ ensures deadlines are met.

Data Engineer â€“ responsible for dataset collection & preprocessing.

ML/DL Engineer â€“ builds & trains the model.

Evaluator/Tester â€“ handles metrics, testing & optimization.

Presenter â€“ prepares final presentation/demo.

Choose a real-world problem statement. Examples:

Predicting customer churn in telecom.

Detecting fake news using NLP.

Image classification (e.g., medical X-rays, product defects).

Sentiment analysis for reviews.

```

# ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Problem Definition & Dataset Selection (45 mins)

Clearly define the problem statement and scope.

Identify target variable/output.

Select a dataset (from Kaggle, UCI Repository, or other open datasets).

Ensure dataset is clean, relevant, and sufficient in size.

Document dataset details:

Source

Number of samples & features

Any limitations

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Data Preprocessing & EDA (1 hour)

Handle missing values, duplicates, and noise.

Apply feature scaling/encoding if needed.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics

Data distribution (histograms, plots)

Correlation heatmaps

Split data into train, validation, and test sets.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Model Development (1.5 hours)

Select suitable ML/DL models:

ML: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost

DL: CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformers (if relevant)

Use frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.

Train baseline model and note initial performance.

Iterate with hyperparameter tuning and optimization.

Track performance using metrics:

Classification â†’ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Regression â†’ MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Model Evaluation & Optimization (1 hour)

Compare different models and choose the best-performing one.

Apply techniques like:

Regularization

Dropout (for DL)

Cross-validation

Early stopping

Ensure the model is generalized (not overfitting/underfitting).

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Deployment (45 mins)

Create a basic deployment pipeline:

Option 1: Flask/FastAPI web service

Option 2: Streamlit/Gradio app for interactive demo

Test model predictions on new/unseen data.

Ensure usability & clarity in the deployed interface.

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Final Presentation (30 mins)

Structure of presentation:

Problem Statement & Motivation

Dataset & Preprocessing

Model Selection & Development

Results & Evaluation Metrics

Deployment Demo

Challenges & Learnings

Future Scope

Presentation should include:

Slides (with visuals & graphs)

Live demo (if possible)

Q&A session
